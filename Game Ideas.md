Order of Operations:
1. Think of base game mechanics
	1. how does magic work?
	2. what kind of system (more combat or narrative focused)
2. Think of player-based mechanics/skills
	1. Independent magic skill
		- go into specializations (i.e. divine, necromancy, wizardry to name a few)
3. Work on dice/balance math

## Possible Uses:
2d12 or 2d10 systems
- 2d12: min = 2, avg = 13, max = 24
- 2d10: min = 2, avg = 11, max =20

# Definite Yes's
1. Check based system similar to D&D or Pathfinder
	- Glancing blow incorporated into this
		- Match Difficulty Value in Combat => Half Damage
		- Match Difficulty Value out of Combat => Success


# Neill Ideas
Magic system: Similar to Divinity Magic specialization
